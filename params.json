{"name":"The Tomb Owner's","tagline":"","body":"I read an article recently about Hexo, which is used by Paul to construct his blog.\r\n\r\nThat's a weird thing, because he and i rent a web server, and i made a lot of effort to construct a Wordpress and a Ghost (both are blogging systems), and he just uses github pages.\r\n\r\nAnd the article shows me why many people dont like running their own blogging system at all. And I totally agree with.\r\n\r\nIT IS SO TIME CONSUMING! I dont like always checking if the network is connected, checking if the pages shows all right, checking if anyone is attempting to hack that server. The most unadorable thing is that my server is in Seattle and due to relative laws and legislations i may disconnect it occassionally.\r\n\r\nWell, so I am here to meet Github pages.\r\n\r\nDue to some reasons, i may still need to write some of my private experiences in that Sometimes-Disconnected ghost blog.\r\n\r\nBut i think i need to move my tech blogs here just for safety.(I CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER DATA LOSS!)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
